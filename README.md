Sample Bot to get started with

## Setup
To be able to make a Discord bot, you will need two things.  
First of all, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org). This software is needed to run the bot.  
Then go into the directory where the bot's code is stored and open it in a new Terminal or Command Prompt window.  
In the terminal, you will need to enter `npm install discord.js`. This downloads the Discord bot API onto the directory of your code.  
With all of that done, you can now begin writing your bot.

### How to get a token?
To aquire a token, you need to have made a Discord bot on their website.  
To do this, you need to make an application, which you can do by going to [discord.com](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and clicking on the "New Application" button in the top right hand corner.  
Once you have made your application, navigate to the bots menu by clicking on the "Bot" button on the left side of the screen.  
Then you can click on the "Add Bot" button that can be found on the right side of the screen to make a bot.
Discord will create a bot for you, and a token attached to the bot will come with it.  
Then you can simply copy the token **(don't give it to anyone untrustworthy)** and place it in [config.json](https://github.com/Lugia-is-OP/Sample_Bot/blob/main/config.json)
